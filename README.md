## Project Overview

Conversational AI systems rely heavily on context management and memory efficiency to ensure meaningful, contextually relevant interactions. This repository explores:
- **Summary-Based Memory**: Condensing conversation histories to optimize memory usage.
- **Reusable Memory Classes**: Building modular and flexible memory structures.
- **Expression Language Integration**: Enhancing adaptability with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).

Through hands-on examples in Jupyter notebooks, youâ€™ll learn practical implementations for these features, enabling you to build robust conversational AI systems.

---

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage with tokenization and summarization techniques.
- **Reusable Classes**: Modular memory classes for long-term and short-term context management.
- **Expression Language**: Incorporate dynamic calculations and evaluations into conversations using LCEL.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: The primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for writing and testing code.
- **LangChain**: Framework for managing memory and workflows in AI-driven applications.
- **pip**: For dependency management.

## Notebook Descriptions

### 1. Conversational_Summary_Memory.ipynb

This notebook introduces summary-based memory techniques to handle conversation context efficiently.

#### Highlights:
- Reduces memory overhead by summarizing conversation histories.
- Demonstrates integration with LangChain memory modules.

#### Code Example:
```python
from langchain.memory import SummaryMemory

memory = SummaryMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "Hi, how are you?"}, {"response": "I'm fine, thank you."})
print(memory.load_memory_variables({}))
```

---

### 2. Langchain_memory_classes.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how to create reusable and modular memory classes in LangChain.

#### Highlights:
- Implements conversation buffer memory for short-term and long-term context storage.
- Provides insights into storing and retrieving memory entries.

#### Code Example:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.add_memory_entry("What is LangChain?")
print(memory.get_memory_entries())
```

---

### 3. LCEL(Langchain_Expression_Language).ipynb

This notebook focuses on integrating LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to evaluate dynamic expressions.

#### Highlights:
- Enables logical calculations and dynamic adaptability in conversational systems.
- Demonstrates seamless integration into conversational workflows.

#### Code Example:
```python
from langchain.expression_language import evaluate_expression

result = evaluate_expression("2 + 2 * 5")
print("Result:", result)
```
