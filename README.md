## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and implement memory management solutions for conversational AI systems using LangChain. The notebooks cover:
- Summarizing long conversations to reduce memory usage.
- Creating reusable and efficient memory classes for context management.
- Implementing LCEL for dynamic and adaptive conversational AI workflows.

By following the examples in this repository, developers can learn to design and deploy robust memory systems for their AI applications.
